use the devop layer
govendor sound like a good stuff!!
have fun with govendor, build own dependences through govendor add +external and remove useing govendor remove your/pathOfRemovalFile +local
sucessfully deployed the transaction!!
note the the core2.yaml replace path_version to 0.6.2-preview

something wrong with enrollment certificate  fix it !!

use the Tcert

forget about deployment
useing invoke!

need something to mansure execution time

use another chaincode to do this!


still have something to fullfill like use flag, add a loop to tell user when will stop, draw....

the spent time is longer than from executeOne to execDoneSync because time spent at sending txs will also be caculated!

make conclusion
